      <h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The Sylphy Bot ("the Bot") is owned and operated by Tomenon#4556 ("We", "Us").</p>
        <p>Use of the Sylphy Bot is at-will and can be terminated at any time by us for any reason.</p>
        <p>Reasons for termination of use include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <p>1. Using the Bot in ways that violate the Discord Terms of Service,</p>
        <p>2. Using the Bot in ways that violate the Karuta Bot rules,</p>
        <p>3. Automating interactions with the Bot, either with a bot or by self-botting,</p>
        <p>4. Causing intentional strain on the Bot to impede proper performance, and</p>
        <p>5. Monetizing access to the Bot.</p>
        <br>
        <p>By using the Bot, inviting the Bot to your server, or using a server that the Bot has joined, 
          you are agreeing to the Bot's Terms of Service. If you do not agree to be bound to the Bot's 
          Terms of Service, you do not have permission to use the Bot.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Sylphy Bot is not affiliated with Discord nor the Karuta Bot.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <h1>USAGE</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The purpose of the Sylphy Bot is to be an organized search tool for information within the Karuta Bot. 
          All information provided by the Sylphy Bot is publicly accessible to users of the Karuta Bot. 
          All information provided by the Sylphy Bot is for entertainment and informational purposes only. 
          By agreeing to the Sylphy Bot Terms of Service, you are agreeing to use the information and data provided 
          by the Sylphy Bot for its intended purposes only.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p><strong>All user information collected by the Sylphy Bot is publicly accessible to anyone with a Discord account.</strong></p>
        <p>By using the Sylphy Bot, inviting the Bot to your server, using a server that the Bot has joined, or in 
          some other way agreeing to the Sylphy Bot Terms of Service, you are also accepting this privacy policy and agreement. 
          This privacy policy is written to outline the kind of data that the Bot collects and stores, and also how this data is used.</p>
        <p>Data we collect:</p>
        <p>1. User ID: The identification number attached to all user accounts. This number is publicly accessible to anyone with a 
          Discord account, and can be seen after enabling Developer Mode in the Discord settings. We store User IDs in order to 
          identify the artists ("sketchers") of the images contained in the Sylphy Bot search library. The User IDs we collect 
          are read automatically from embedded messages from the Karuta Bot.</p>
        <p>2. Channel ID: The identification number attached to all guild channels. This number is publicly accessible to anyone 
          with a Discord account, and can be seen after enabling Developer Mode in the Discord settings. We store Channel IDs to 
          flag specific channels as "display channels". The Bot will automatically display into flagged channels any new entry to 
          the Sylphy Bot's search library as they are entered. Channel IDs are not stored automatically, but rather, are only stored 
          at the request the Guild owner(s) for any guild to which the stored channel belongs.</p>
        <p>3. Message Content and Embeds: The Sylphy Bot updates its library by reading "Card" data from Karuta Bot's embedded messages. 
          The data read from these embedded messages includes "Series Names", "Character Names", "Character Aliases", "Card IDs", 
          "Print Numbers", "Edition Numbers", "Card Ink", "Card Inkwells", "Sketcher IDs", and the embedded messages' thumbnail images. 
          This data is accessible to all verified users of the Karuta Bot. This data is only obtained from the Karuta Bot's messages. 
          Message Content from the Sylphy Bot's users' messages is analyzed to process text commands, but no non-bot user message content is stored.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We do not sell or share any collected data with any third parties.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <h1>DATA DELETION</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Any user may request at any time for us to remove their User ID or Channel IDs by joining the support server linked in the Sylphy Bot's profile. 
          However, all User IDs stored in the Sylphy Bot are collected from the Karuta Bot's messages, not from the users themselves. Unless a user first 
          requests their data deletion from the Karuta Bot, removing their data from the Sylphy Bot will only temporarily remove their User ID, and the User ID 
          is at risk of being recorded again unless the user requests data deletion from the Karuta Bot first.</p>
