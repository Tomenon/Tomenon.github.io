      <h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The Sylphy Bot ("the Bot") and the Reference Assistant bot ("the Assistant), collectively "the Bots", are owned and operated by Tomenon ("We", "Us").</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to terminate your use of the Sylphy Bot or the Reference Assistant bot at any time and for any reason.</p>
        <p>Reasons for termination of use include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <p>1. Using the Bots in ways that violate the Discord Terms of Service,</p>
        <p>2. Using the Bots in ways that violate the Karuta Bot rules,</p>
        <p>3. Automating interactions with the Bots, either with a bot or by self-botting,</p>
        <p>4. Causing intentional strain on the Bots to impede proper performance, and</p>
        <p>5. Monetizing access to the Bots.</p>
        <p>6. Intentionally uploading images that are graphic, obscene, or that contain nudity to either bot.</p>
        <br>
        <p>By using the Bots, inviting the Bots to your server, or using a server that the Bots have joined, 
          you are indicating your acceptance of the Bots' Terms of Service. If you do not agree to be bound to the Bots' 
          Terms of Service, you do not have permission to use the Bots.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Sylphy Bot and the Reference Assistant bot are not affiliated with Discord nor the Karuta Bot.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h1>USAGE</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The purpose of the Sylphy Bot is to be an organized search tool for information within the Karuta Bot. 
          All information provided by the Sylphy Bot is publicly accessible to users of the Karuta Bot. 
          All information provided by the Sylphy Bot is for entertainment and informational purposes only.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the Reference Assistant bot is to limit the color palette of a user-provided image to a predetermined set of 64 colors.</p>
        <p>By agreeing to these Terms of Service, you are agreeing to use the information and data provided 
          by the Sylphy Bot and the Reference Assistant bot for their intended purposes only.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p><strong>All user information collected by the Sylphy Bot and the Reference Assistant bot is accessible by any Discord user.</strong></p>
        <p>By using the Bots, inviting the Bots to your server, using a server that the Bots have joined, or in 
          some other way agreeing to the Sylphy Bot and Reference Assistant Terms of Service, you are also accepting this privacy policy and agreement. 
          This privacy policy is written to outline the kind of data that the Bots collect and store, and also how this data is used.</p>
        <p>Data we collect:</p>
        
        <p>1. User ID: The identification number attached to all user accounts. User IDs are accessible to anyone with a 
          Discord account, and can be seen after enabling Developer Mode in the Discord settings. The Sylphy Bot stores User IDs in order to 
          identify the artists ("sketchers") of the images contained in the Sylphy Bot search library. The Sylphy Bot collects User IDs 
          automatically from embedded messages sent by the Karuta Bot. The Reference Assitant bot stores User IDs in order to provide a 
          user-specific image history library. The Reference Assistant bot collects User IDs automatically when users issue commands 
          to the Assistant.</p>
        
        <p>2. Channel ID: The identification number attached to all guild channels. Channel IDs are accessible to anyone 
          with a Discord account, and can be seen after enabling Developer Mode in the Discord settings. We store Channel IDs to 
          flag specific channels as operable as a "display channel" (for the Sylphy Bot) or as a "conversion channel" (for the Reference Assistant). 
          The Sylphy Bot will automatically display into flagged "display channels" any new entry to the Sylphy Bot's search library as they are 
          entered. The Reference Assistant bot will only convert images if they are posted into a flagged "conversion channel. 
          We store Channel IDs only at the request of the Guild owner(s) for any guild to which the stored channel belongs, and they are only stored manually.</p>
        
        <p>3. Message ID: The identification number attached to all Discord messages. Message IDs are accessible to anyone 
          with a Discord account, and can be seen after enabling Developer Mode in the Discord settings. We store Message IDs for use in file names for the 
          images sent by the Reference Assistant. Using Message IDs in file names ensures no duplicate file name occurs.

        <p>4. Message Content and Embeds: The Sylphy Bot updates its library by reading "Card" data from Karuta Bot's embedded messages. 
          The data read from these embedded messages includes "Series Names", "Character Names", "Character Aliases", "Card IDs", 
          "Print Numbers", "Edition Numbers", "Card Ink", "Card Inkwells", "Sketcher IDs", and the embedded messages' thumbnail images. 
          This data is accessible to all verified users of the Karuta Bot. This data is only obtained from the Karuta Bot's messages. 
          We analyze Message Content from the Sylphy Bot's users' messages to process text commands, but we do not store any non-bot user message content.
          The Reference Assistant accesses the images attached to user messages sent in a flagged "conversion channel" in order to analyze the image and 
          reduce the color palette of the image. The original image sent by the user is not stored by the Reference Assistant; only the converted image is stored.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We do not sell or share any collected data with any third parties.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <h1>DATA DELETION</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Users may request at any time for us to remove their User ID or Channel IDs by joining the support server linked in the Sylphy Bot's and 
          the Reference Assistant's profiles. 
          However, all User IDs stored in the Sylphy Bot are collected from the Karuta Bot's messages, not from the users themselves. Unless a user first 
          requests their data deletion from the Karuta Bot, removing their data from the Sylphy Bot will only temporarily remove their User ID, and the User ID 
          is at risk of being recorded again unless the user requests data deletion from the Karuta Bot first.</p>
